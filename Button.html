<h1>What Is 5G IoT?</h1>
<p style="background-color: aqua;">
    5G is about a new communication system includes a mostly New Radio (5G NR) framework and an entirely new core network that aims to improve wireless connections worldwide. It also includes the concept of multiple access for connectivity technologies like satellites, Wi-Fi, fixed-line and cellular (as standardized by 3GPP). With IoT-enabled devices in mind, 5G connects more devices at higher speeds and makes things like lag nearly non-existent. As a result, 5G creates an excellent user experience irrespective of what application, device or service you touch. Massive cellular IoT technologies are characterized as a low-cost, low-power consumption solution. They thrive on deep and broad coverage indoors and outdoors. 
    They deliver secure connectivity and authentication, are easy to deploy to any network topology and are designed for full scope scalability and capacity upgrades. Businesses, city developers and other industrial organizations can connect more devices with better capability for much less â€” all with the power of 5G adaptability at their fingertips.
